## **Feature branches**

Each new feature must exist in its own branch. These grow out of the `Develop` branch and when the feature is completed, it gets merged back into the `Develop` branch. Features should never interact directly with the `Main` branch. An example of this principle can be seen on the workflow below. 

```mermaid
%%{init: {'gitGraph': {'showCommitLabel': false}} }%%
    gitGraph
    commit
    branch develop
    commit
    branch feature1
    branch feature2
    commit
    checkout feature1
    commit
    commit
    checkout feature2
    commit
    checkout develop
    merge feature1
    commit
    checkout main
    merge develop tag:"v0.1"
    checkout feature2
```

Note that `Feature` branches can be merged into `Develop` at any time. The last example shows two `Feature` branches created at the same time but since feature 1 is already done, it can be merged into `Develop` and then into `Main` while the feature 2 is being work on. This can cause merge conflicts at some point.

### **Creating a Feature branch**

To create a `Feature` branch from the `Develop` branch you can type the commands:

```bash
    git checkout develop
    git checkout -b feature_branch
```
Or you can use the tool to assist you by typing

```bash
    git flow feature start feature_branch
```
Either way should initialize or workflow as follows

```mermaid
%%{init: {'gitGraph': {'showCommitLabel': false}} }%%
    gitGraph
    commit
    branch develop
    commit
    branch feature_branch
    commit
```

### **Finishing a Feature branch**

When the development of the feature is comple you merge the branch into the `Develop` branch by typing:

```bash
    git checkout develop
    git merge feature_branch
```

Or using the extension...


```bash
    git flow feature finish feature_branch
```

Should look something like this

```mermaid
%%{init: {'gitGraph': {'showCommitLabel': false}} }%%
    gitGraph
    commit
    branch develop
    commit
    branch feature_branch
    commit
    checkout develop
    merge feature_branch
```
